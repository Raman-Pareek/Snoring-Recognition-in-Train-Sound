# Snoring-Recognition-in-Train-Sound
This is my Project based on 2D CNN(convolutional Neural Network).
I used spectrogram method to generate spectrograms from wave audio which can be further passed into my CNN model to classify if snoring is present or not.
I got accuracy >95%. I gathered my dataset mainly converting you tube audio to multiple 1 sec long audios and used as my training and testing dataset.
